# 🧱 Solidity Basics & MetaMask Integration

Welcome to my **Solidity Basics** repository — a collection of smart contracts and practical snippets I built while learning the fundamentals of **Ethereum**, **Solidity**, and **MetaMask** interaction.

This repo focuses on understanding how blockchain logic works at the core — from basic data types to state-changing functions and wallet connectivity.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains:
- ✳️ **Fundamental Solidity examples** — `bool`, `uint`, `string`, `array`, `mapping`, and more.
- 🔗 **MetaMask experiments** — wallet connection logic, testing transactions on Remix.
- 🧠 **Mini learning projects** — small snippets to understand real-world blockchain concepts.
- 🧰 **Remix-friendly structure** — all contracts can be tested directly on [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
